###Because of Twitter stubborness, The program keys have no way of being hidden in an open sourced program, therefore once you download Libertas, email me and I will send you the program keys. Then you will be able to authorize Libertas for your own account.

###libertas.py depends on the tweepy library for interfacing with the twitter API.
###Make sure you get tweepy for python 2.7.
