What options that are not set by the user will assume defaults.\r\n3. ed is short for education. It is a bot similar to ffbot that will tweet a list of lines from a text file, such as quotes or facts.\r\n4. list_check will scan a file one line at a time for lines over 140 characters long, and report that line, which can then be edited.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Usage:\r\n* `python libertas.py tweet \"STRING\"` simply sends the string as tweet to twitter.\r\n\r\n* `python libertas.py ffbot` with no options enters interactive mode, which will ask you to select the number of the list you want to tweet, then the wait in seconds between 30-3600 [default=300]. Next it will ask for the path to the intros file you want to use. Once you press enter, ffbot will pick a random intro, break up the twitter list to smaller lists of six users and format them, and then tweet each one after the number of seconds specified.\r\n\r\n* `python libertas.py ffbot -l 0 -s 300 -f \"data/intros.txt\"` is used here with all the defaults. If you omit one or two options, the defaults will be supplied by the program, and of course, with no options, it enters interactive mode.\r\n\r\n* `python libertas.py ed -s 300 \"data/quotes.txt\"` The -s is optional, and defaults to 300. The path to the file to tweet is required. My goal to create ed files according to subject, and which can be submitted and contributed to.\r\n* `python libertas.py list_check \"FILE\"` checks \"FILE\" line by line and counts characters, reporting a line with more than 140 characters. Good for checking intro and ed lists.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nlibertas.py was written in python 2.7 and requires the tweepy library [tweepy-1.11.tar.gz](http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/t/tweepy/tweepy-1.11.tar.gz) or later.\r\n\r\n### More to Come...\r\nIntro and exit files help ensure that libertas doesn't crash because of a duplicate tweet. I have provided a zipped file of libertas data that I hope can be user-contributed on Dropbox or Google Docs or something and uploaded  to the repo for sharing. \r\n\r\n###This zip contains ed_intros.txt, ed_exits.txt, intros.txt, ff_exits.txt and quotes.txt\r\n[libertas data](https://github.com/downloads/godsofliberty/libertas/libertas_data.zip)\r\n\r\nEmail me godsofliberty@lavabit.com","name":"Libertas","tagline":"Libertas is a suite of cli tools intended for the twitter liberty activist, but files can be customized for your needs."}
