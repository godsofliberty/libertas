Good for checking intro and ed lists.\r\n\r\n### All optional options have set defaults.\r\n\r\n### Examples:\r\n``libertas.py ffbot -l 0`` will set the twitter list to the first list you have on twitter and fill in the other options with defaults( --seconds=300 --file=\"data/intros.txt\")\r\nThis will split the twitter list into multiple lists of six users per list, and add the @ symbol to their names. Next, file intros.txt will be loaded, randomized and one will be selected and tweeted. Next the 300 forces libertas to wait 300 seconds after every tweet.\r\n\r\nlibertas.py was written in python 2.7 and requires the tweepy library [tweepy-1.11.tar.gz](http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/t/tweepy/tweepy-1.11.tar.gz) or later.\r\n### More to Come...\r\n\r\n"}
