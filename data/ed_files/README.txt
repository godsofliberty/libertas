This directory is intended to hold files of tweets that ed can tweet.

Ed is a tweet bot, short for education.

My goal is to create numerous files, each dealing with various subjects.

The naming convention should be ed_subject.txt

The quotes.txt file is just an example.

I hope many of you contribute ed files to this directory , which will periodically distributed with libertas.

Feel free to edit, delete and add to your heart's content.

Remember, twitter has a 140 character limit. Fortunately, libertas contains a tool to scan a file and report character numbers.
