This directory is intended to hold files of intro tweets.

When every bot starts, it will randomize the appropriate intro file and select one to tweet. This is done to avoid twitter duplicate crashes.

My goal is to create as many intro tweets as possible.

Feel free to add, edit, or delete as you see fit.

I hope many of you contribute to the ed_intros.txt and ff_intros.txt files in this directory , which will periodically be distributed with libertas.

Remember, twitter has a 140 character limit. Fortunately, libertas contains a tool to scan a file and report character numbers.
