This directory is meant to be put in the libertas/data/ directory to enhance the libertas experience. Its name should be access

It is my belief that a group effort in editing these files will lead to a greater program, and I encourage all of you to contribute.

My goal is to create as many entries in these files as possible.

Feel free to add, edit, or delete as you see fit.

I hope many of you contribute to the ed_intros.txt and ff_intros.txt files in the ed_intros and ff_intros directories, and the ed_exits.txt and ff_exits.txt in the ed_exits and ff_exits directories. All intro and exit tweets are selected randomly from the chosen file respectively.

ed_files is by far the most important directory. Ed is a tweet bot, short for education.

My goal is to create numerous files, each dealing with various subjects.

The naming convention should be ed_'subject'.txt

The ed_quotes.txt file is an example.

Add as many ed files as your knowledge on a particular subject will allow in the ed_files directory. These files will be periodically updated and available for download from the http://godsofliberty.github.com/libertas website.

The text files that make Libertas what it is crave input from users or anyone who wants to collaborate on the project.

Now you can do so with dropbox, even if you dont have an account with them, but it will be easier if you do.

If you have Dropbx and want to collaborate, email me and I will share the directory(ies) with you.

Remember, twitter has a 140 character limit. Fortunately, libertas contains a tool to scan a file and report character numbers.

I will be adding more tools to libertas soon, in particualar, a keyword retweeter.
