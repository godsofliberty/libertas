This directory is intended to hold files of exit tweets.

After every bot finishes the last tweet, it will randomize the appropriate exit file and select one to tweet. This is done to avoid twitter duplicate crashes.

My goal is to create as many exit tweets as possible.

Feel free to add, edit, or delete as you see fit.

I hope many of you contribute to the ed_exits.txt and ff_exits.txt files in this directory , which will periodically be distributed with libertas.

Remember, twitter has a 140 character limit. Fortunately, libertas contains a tool to scan a file and report character numbers.

Feel free to email me at godsofliberty@lavabit.com
