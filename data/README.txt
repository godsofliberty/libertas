These directories are meant to be put in the libertas/data directory to enhance the libertas experience.

It is my belief that a group effort in editing these files will lead to a greater program, and I encourage all of you to contribute.

Download libertas at http://godsofliberty.github.com/libertas

My goal is to create as many entries in these files as possible.

Feel free to add, edit, or delete as you see fit.

I hope many of you contribute to the ed_intros.txt and ff_intros.txt files in the intros directory, and the ed_exits.txt and ff_exits.txt in the exits directory, and add as many ed files as your knowledge on a particular subject allow in the ed directory. These files will be periodically distributed with libertas.

The text files that make Libertas what it is crave input from users or anyone who wants to collaborate on the project. Now you can do so with dropbox, even if you dont have an account with them, but it will be easier if you do.

The links are:

If you have Dropbx and want to collaborate, email me and I will share the directory(ies) with you.

This modified data will be periodically uploaded to the libertas site and can get them here: 
https://github.com/downloads/godsofliberty/libertas/
Note the filename will change based on upload date.

Remember, twitter has a 140 character limit. Fortunately, libertas contains a tool to scan a file and report character numbers.

I will be adding more tools to libertas soon, in particualar, a keyword retweeter.
