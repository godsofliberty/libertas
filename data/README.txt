These directories are meant to be put in the libertas/data directory to enhance the libertas experience.

It is my belief that a group effort in editing these files will lead to a greater program, and I encourage all of you to contribute.

My goal is to create as many entries in these files as possible.

Feel free to add, edit, or delete as you see fit.

I hope many of you contribute to the ed_intros.txt and ff_intros.txt files in the intros directory, and the ed_exits.txt and ff_exits.txt in the exits directory, and add as many ed files as your knowledge on a particular subject allow in the ed directory. These files will be periodically distributed with libertas.

Remember, twitter has a 140 character limit. Fortunately, libertas contains a tool to scan a file and report character numbers.

I will be adding more tools to libertas soon, in particualar, a keyword retweeter.
