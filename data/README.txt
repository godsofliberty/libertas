This directory holds the keys directory for authorization, the intros and extros for the bots, and ed files, lists of tweets to be tweeted at set intervals.

It is my belief that a group effort in editing these files will lead to a greater program, and I encourage all of you to contribute.

Feel free to add, edit, or delete as you see fit.

All the intros and extros are randomized so you never know what the first and last tweets might be!

ed is, by far, the most important directory. Ed is a tweet bot, short for education.

My goal is to create numerous files, each dealing with various subjects.

The naming convention should be ed_'subject'.txt

The ed_quotes.txt file is an example.

Add as many ed files as your knowledge on a particular subject will allow in the ed directory. These files will be periodically updated and available for download from the http://godsofliberty.github.com/libertas website.

Now you can do so with dropbox, even if you dont have an account with them, but it will be easier if you do.

The link is: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ifqf2ka3r33pt1i/access.zip

If you have Dropbx and want to collaborate, email me and I will share the directory(ies) with you.

Remember, twitter has a 140 character limit. Fortunately, libertas contains a tool to scan a file and report character numbers.

I will be adding more tools to libertas soon, in particualar, a keyword retweeter.
